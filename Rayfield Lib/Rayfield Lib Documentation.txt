Rayfield Interface Suite
This is the written documentation for Rayfield Interface Suite

Last updated for the Beta 5 release

Booting the Library
local Rayfield = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shlexware/Rayfield/main/source'))()
Secure Mode
If the game you're trying to run Rayfield Interface Suite on, is detecting or crashing when you use Rayfield Interface Suite, try using Secure Mode:

Place getgenv().SecureMode = true above the initial Rayfield loadstring
Rayfield will now use Secure Mode and attempt to reduce detection

Note: This may cause some elements of the UI to look lower quality or may increase loading times slightly
Enabling Configuration Saving
Enable ConfigurationSaving in the CreateWindow function
Choose an appropiate FileName in the CreateWindow function
Choose an unique flag identifier for each supported element you create
Place Rayfield:LoadConfiguration() at the bottom of all your code
Rayfield will now automatically save and load your configuration

Creating a Window
local Window = Rayfield:CreateWindow({
	Name = "Nekos GUI 1.2",
	LoadingTitle = "Nekos Universal GUI v1.2",
	LoadingSubtitle = "by Azmac102289p",
	ConfigurationSaving = {
		Enabled = true,
		FolderName = "Nekos GUI",
		FileName = "Neko GUI"
	},
	KeySystem = false, -- Set this to true to use our key system
	KeySettings = {
		Title = "Sirius Hub",
		Subtitle = "Key System",
		Note = "Join the discord (discord.gg/sirius)",
		SaveKey = true,
		Key = "ABCDEF"
	}
})
Creating a Tab
local Tab = Window:CreateTab("Main", 4483362458) -- Title, Image
Creating a Section
local Section = Tab:CreateSection("Main")
Updating a Section
Section:Set("Section Example")
Notifying the user
Rayfield:Notify("Title Example", "Content/Description Example", 4483362458) -- Title, Content, Image
Creating a Button
local Button = Tab:CreateButton({
	Name = "Button Example",
	Callback = function()
		-- The function that takes place when the button is pressed
	end,
})
local Button = Tab:CreateButton({
	Name = "[FE] John Doe",
	Callback = function()
		--[[  
			WARNING: Heads up! This script has not been verified by ScriptBlox. Use at your own risk!  
		]]
		loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://rawscripts.net/raw/Universal-Script-John-doe-v2-29135"))()
	end
})

	Flag = "Toggle1", -- A flag is the identifier for the configuration file, make sure every element has a different flag if you're using configuration saving to ensure no overlaps
	Callback = function(Value)
		-- The function that takes place when the toggle is pressed
    		-- The variable (Value) is a boolean on whether the toggle is true or false
	end,
})
Updating a Toggle
Toggle:Set(false)
Creating a Color Picker
Not in Beta 5

})
Creating a Keybind
local Keybind = Tab:CreateKeybind({
	Name = "Keybind Example",
	CurrentKeybind = "K",
	HoldToInteract = false,
	Flag = "Keybind1", -- A flag is the identifier for the configuration file, make sure every element has a different flag if you're using configuration saving to ensure no overlaps
	Callback = function(Keybind)
		-- The function that takes place when the keybind is pressed
    		-- The variable (Keybind) is a boolean for whether the keybind is being held or not (HoldToInteract needs to be true)
	end,
})
Updating a Keybind
Keybind:Set("RightCtrl") -- Keybind (string)
Creating a Dropdown menu
local Dropdown = Tab:CreateDropdown({
	Name = "Dropdown Example",
	Options = {"Option 1","Option 2"},
	CurrentOption = "Option 1",
	Flag = "Dropdown1", -- A flag is the identifier for the configuration file, make sure every element has a different flag if you're using configuration saving to ensure no overlaps
	Callback = function(Option)
	  	  -- The function that takes place when the selected option is changed
    	  -- The variable (Option) is a string for the value that the dropdown was changed to
	end,
})
Updating a Dropdown
Dropdown:Set("Option 2") -- The new option value
Check the value of an existing element
To check the current value of an existing element, using the variable, you can do ElementName.CurrentValue, if it's a keybind or dropdown, you will need to use KeybindName.CurrentKeybind or DropdownName.CurrentOption

Destroying the Interface
Rayfield:Destroy()
